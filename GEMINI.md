This tool is a CLI wrapper for the markitdown library by Microsoft.

I want to publish this CLI tool to pypi. This way i can install it from any system later on.

goal:
pipx install markitdown-cli
# then use
markitdown-cli https://example.com


the tool itself is pretty much working. i just want you to handle all the configuration details and make the tool ready to publish to PyPi.
